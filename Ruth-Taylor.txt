        The Anchor tag <A>, Image tag <IMG> and the Font tag <FONT>, require at least one attribute to function properly and to be                correctly interpreted by a Web browser.
    
    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
    
        The <head> element can include a title for the document, scripts, styles, meta information, and more
    
    7. What is an id? 
    
        We use id to uniquely identify things.
     
    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
    
       The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). The id                  value can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for the element with the specific id value. In CSS, to                  select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
     
    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
    
        An id value can occur only once on a page.
    
    10. What is a class? 
    
        The class attribute specifies a classname for an element.
        The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.

    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
    
        elements including (but not limited to) colours, layout, fonts, and animations
    
    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
    
        It is perfectly normal to use the same id on different pages. Usually you'll make a skeleton/template for your layout, where             each element will be styled the same on each page that uses this template. It is then helpful to have the same id for the               same element across different pages.
    
    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
    
        You can open the information on new tab by clicking on the link in various manner. Press the middle button or scroll wheel on           your mouse (if you mouse has the middle click ability) on the link you want to open in a tab. Right click on the link and select         open in new tab
    
    14. What is the alt attribute used for? 
    
        The alt attribute is the HTML attribute used in HTML and XHTML documents to specify alternative text (alt text) that is to be           rendered when the element to which it is applied cannot be rendered. The alt attribute is used by "screen reader" software so           that a person who is listening to the content of a webpage (for instance, a person who is blind) can interact with this element.
    
    15. How do I reference an id?
    
         Definition and Usage. The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML              document). The id attribute is most used to point to a style in a style sheet, and by JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to                  manipulate       the element with the specific id.
    
     <html>
        <body>
          <h1 id="myHeader">Hello World!</h1>
            <button onclick="displayResult()">Change text</button>
              <script>...
    
    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
    
        The only difference between the DIV and SECTION elements is semantics—the meaning of the content you're dividing up. Any content         contained in a DIV element has no inherent meaning. The DIV element used to be the only element available for adding hooks to           style documents and layouts.
    
    17. What is CSS used for?

    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
    
        The HTML <h2> tag defines the second level heading in the HTML document. This tag is also commonly referred to as the <h2>               element.
        The HTML <h2> element is found within the <body> tag.
        Headings can range from <h1> to <h6>. The most important heading is <h1> and the least important heading is <h6>.
        The <h2> heading is found after the <h1> heading. You do not skip heading levels.
        The <h2> heading will generally appear slightly smaller in font than the <h1> heading.
    
    
    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
    
        A class can be used several times, while an ID can only be used once, so you should use classes for items that you know you're           going to use a lot. An example would be if you wanted to give all the paragraphs on your webpage the same styling, you would use         classes. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.
    
    
    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
    
        The HTML class attribute is used to define equal styles for elements with the same class name. All HTML elements with the same           class attribute will get the same style.

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar? 
    
        Two column layouts on the web are very common for basic sites. Generally, they consist of a header, footer and then two columns         in the content area. One column is for the main content while the other is a sidebar.
        The essential CSS code for a centered 2 column layout with the CSS on the left is as follows.
       
         #sidebar {
         float: left;       /* This causes the sidebar to move to the left */
         width: 260px;      /* We need to set the width whenever we float an element */
    
    24. What is a pseudo selector?
    
        "Pseudo-selectors" is an umbrella term used to cover both kinds of selectors (or really any selector that begins with at least           one : ), but it is itself meaningless, because in Selectors, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are two fundamentally different         things.
    
    
    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?
    
        To change the spacing between lines of text in a specific block: Click on the Edit icon on the section where you want to change         the line spacing. On the left panel, click on or in the toolbar of the block, click on the HTML button. Look for the "Line-             Height" attribute in the code.
    
    
    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
    
        Selecting Expanded or Condensed alters the spacing between all selected letters by the same amount. Kerning alters the spacing           between particular pairs of letters - in some cases reducing and in other cases expanding the space depending upon the letters.         Expand or condense the space evenly between all the selected characters              
    
    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
    
       Highlight all the text you want to change. Hold down the Shift key and press F3. When you hold Shift and press F3, the text              toggles from sentence case (first-letter uppercase and the rest lowercase), to all uppercase (all capital letters), and then all        lowercase.

        Type dir in the command line
    
    
    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
    
        By using git-rm to remove files from the working tree and the index, again before using the commit command.  Make sure this is           what you want because the removal is permenant.
    
    
    34. Why should I use version control? 
    
        Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions           later.  It also allows you to revert selected filed back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous               state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and           when, and more.
